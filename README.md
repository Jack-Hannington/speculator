Altius Wellness is a modern online wellness platform offering tailored wellness and physiotherapy plans based on user scores on in-person or online assessements. 

Users are graded across 7 base categories including weight, heart rate, strength, mental wellbing, mobility, blood pressure and recovery. The assessments give the user a score 1, 3 or 5 depending on their results per question. For example a user may average 4 hours of sleep per night which would give them a score of 1. Sleep is part of the recovery section of the assessment so 1 will be added to their recovery whereas if they answered 8+ hours they might receive a 5 on the score. Other questions will be asked to give an overall recovery score. This repeats for 7 categories before all scores are added up.

After an assessment the scores will update on the user's dashboard as top-level score cards where they can review them, compare with similar users - this is locked to their company participants if their on a corporate package and scores an anonymised so it's a "you're in the top 20%" of people in your age group / gender. Below the scorecards will be a series of plans for users to undertake to improve their scores before any follow-up assessment. The user's can choose their own goals and begin the chosen plans. Each plan will have a series of help guides, articles and resources to help improve their wellness. once enrolled users will receive a series of emails to keep them updated and on-track to improve their wellbeing. Once a user has read a resource and completed an exercise they can mark it as complete to see their progress. 

There is a users table, plans table, content table, content makes up what a plan is, completed_assessments, tenants (for business customers who add their employees)
